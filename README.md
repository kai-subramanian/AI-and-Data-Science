# AI-and-Data-Science
A space, dedicated entirely to AI and Data themed learnings.
I will be following the path provided by roadmap.sh; they have a comprehensive curriculum along with sources from where to learn.
First, we start off with introduction to mathematics. I was initially using LaTeX to format my notes, but I found it too time-consuming and decided to scan upload my own handwritten notes. 
Next, data analytics projects from freeCodeCamp. I will be moving to Machine Learning next, and from there an LLM which I (hopefully) build on my own.

Keep watching this space for more:)
