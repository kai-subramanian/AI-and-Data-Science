Basics of Matrix Algebra

A matrix is a 2D Array, of one more rows and one or more columns. Denoted by a<sub>i,j<sub>

We have diagonal and triangular matrix.

[ [2,0,0] 
  [0,3,0]
  [0,0,1] ] -> is an example of diagonal matrix.

Identity matrix - I<sub>2</sub> -> [
															[1,0]
															[0,1]
															]

Matrices are said to be equal if dimensions and corresponding elements are equal.

Vector algebra denotes the addition and subtraction of 2 matrices.

A = [1,-1,3]
      [2,0,1] 
and B = [1,1,0]
             [2,1,3]
A+B = [2,0,3]
           [4,1,4]

A-B = [0,-2,3]
           [0,-1,-2]

Matrix addition follows associative and commutative law.

Scalar Multiplication

y * A<sub>i,j</sub> = [[y*a11,y*a12]
		                              [y*a21,y*a22]

Important remark - columns of first matrix should be equal to row of first matrix.

(5x3) * (3x4) = (5x4)
